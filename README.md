# CENotes Reaction
## A react js frontend solution for the CENotes backend

- __Free software: GNU General Public License v3__


### What is this?
This is a frontend solution to use for the [CENotes backend](https://github.com/ioparaskev/cenotes)

### Features
Everything the latest version CENotes backend supports 

- Stored / on-the-fly symmetrically encrypted notes
  - Notes can be stored on the server (only the encrypted binary, no key information is stored)
  - Notes can be persistent so that that they are not stored on the server (bigger urls) 
- Duress keys that trigger deletion of a stored note 
  - Using the duresss key instead of the real decryption key will delete the note 
  and respond as if the note didnâ€™t exist (to avoid indicating the use of the duress key)
- Expiration date setting for stored encrypted notes (default 2 weeks)
  - After that date, the notes are deleted and cannot be retrieved (default is never)
- Maximum visits setting for stored encrypted notes (default 1, maximum 100)
  - After N retrievals of a note, the note is deleted (default is 1)
- QR codes for decrypt and duress links


### How to use
Two options:

1. Cloning the repo and running the NodeJS server with the React components
    1. Clone the repo
        -  `git clone https://github.com/ioparaskev/cenotes-reaction.git`
    2. Install the dependencies
        - `npm install`
    3. Start the server
        - `npm run start`
2. Using the packaged bundle
    1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/ioparaskev/cenotes-reaction/releases)
    2. Extract, rename as you wish and serve the build folder
        - Example of an nginx configuration (build folder is renamed-> `cenotes-ui`)
        ```
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name <your server name / ip>;
        
            # CENOTES-FRONTEND
            root /var/www/html/cenotes-ui;
            index index.html index.htm;
        
            location ~* \.(?:manifest|appcache|html?|xml|json)$ {
              expires -1;
            }
        
            location ~* \.(?:css|js)$ {
              try_files $uri =404;
              expires 1y;
              access_log off;
              add_header Cache-Control "public";
            }
        
            # Any route containing a file extension (e.g. /devicesfile.js)
            location ~ ^.+\..+$ {
              try_files $uri =404;
            }
        
            # Any route that doesn't have a file extension (e.g. /devices)
            location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
            }
        }
        ```
    3. You will also need to include the endpoint of your backend application
        - Example of nginx configuration for backend running as a uwsgi socket 
        ```
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name <your server name / ip>;
            # CENOTES-BACKEND
                location /notes {
                    include uwsgi_params;
                    uwsgi_pass  unix:/run/uwsgi/app/cenotes/cenotes.sock;
            #proxy_pass http://83.212.96.88;
                }
        }
        ```
        - Example of nginx configuration for backend running in another site
        ```
        server {
            listen 80;
            server_name <your server name / ip>;
            # CENOTES-BACKEND
                location /notes {
                    proxy_pass http://<backend_url>:<port>;
                }
        }
        ```
